.SH  NAME
simple_shell \- Simple command interpreter (shell)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell
[file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
SImple SHell is a command language interpreter that executes
commands read from the standard input or from a file.

.SH ARGUMENTS
The only argument that should be supplied to the shell
is the name of a file. When this happens,
the shell reads and	executes commands from this	file, then exits.
The shell's exit status is the exit status of the last command
executed in the script. If no commands are executed, the exit
status is 0. An attempt is made to open the file in
the current directory.
." and, if no file is found,	then the shell searches	the
." directories	in PATH	for the	script.

.SH DEFINITIONS
.PP
The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this
document.
.PD 0
.TP
.B blank
A space or tab.
.TP
.B word
A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell.
.TP
.B name
A
.I word
consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, and beginning with an alphabetic character or an underscore.
.TP
.B control operator
A
.I token
that performs a control function. It is one of the
following symbols:
.if t \fB|| && ; <newline>

.SH SHELL GRAMMAR
.SS Simple Commands
A
.I simple command
is a sequence of
.B blank
-separated words that are terminated by a
.I control operator
. The first word specifies the command to be
executed, and is passed as argument zero. The
remaining words are passed as arguments to the
invoked command.

.Br
The return value of a
.I simple command
is its exit status or 128+
.I n
if the command is terminated by signal
.I n

.SH Quoting
.I Quoting
is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or
words to the shell, such as operators or whitespace.
There are two types of quoting: matched single quotes,
and matched double quotes.

.SS Single Quotes
Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal meaning of all
the characters (except single quotes, making it impossible to put
single-quotes in a single-quoted string).

.SS Double Quotes
Enclosing characters within double quotes preserves the literal
meaning of all characters except dollarsign as they're used to signify
the start of a variable or special parameters like ? and $.

.SH Aliases
An alias is a name and corresponding value set using the alias builtin command.
Whenever a word is read, the shell
checks the word to see if it matches an alias.
If it does, it replaces it in the input stream with its value.
For example, if there is an alias called
"put"
with the value
.Dq "echo -e" ,
then the input:
.Pp
.Dl put "\e[31mCool\e[0m" Aq return
.Pp
would become
.Pp
.Dl echo -e "\e[31mCool\e[0m" Aq return
.Pp
Aliases provide a convenient way for naive users to create shorthands for
commands.
They can also be used to create lexically obscure code.
This use is discouraged.

HISTORY
On startup, the history is initialized from the file .simple_shell_history in the $HOME directory.
This file is truncated to
contain no more than 4096 lines of command strings. When the shell startsup,
the first line number is set to  the number of lines in the .simple_shell_history file modulo 4096
(the history size).

aliases in the form
