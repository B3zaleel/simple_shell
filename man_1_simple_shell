.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Bk -words
.Op file
.Bk
.Ek

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf
function produces output according to a
.IB format
as described below.

.Ss Lexical Structure
The shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it up into
words at whitespace (blanks and tabs), and at certain sequences of
characters that are special to the shell called
.Dq operators .
Following is a list of operators:
.Bl -ohang -offset indent
.It "Control operators:"
.Dl &&  \&;  || \*[Lt]newline\*[Gt]
.El

.Ss Quoting
Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or
words to the shell, such as operators or whitespace.
There are two types of quoting: matched single quotes,
and matched double quotes.

.Ss Single Quotes
Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal meaning of all
the characters (except single quotes, making it impossible to put
single-quotes in a single-quoted string).

.Ss Double Quotes
Enclosing characters within double quotes preserves the literal
meaning of all characters except dollarsign as they're used to signify
the start of a variable or special parameters like ? and $.

.Ss Aliases
An alias is a name and corresponding value set using the alias builtin command.
Whenever a word is read, the shell
checks the word to see if it matches an alias.
If it does, it replaces it in the input stream with its value.
For example, if there is an alias called
.Dq put
with the value
.Dq "echo -e" ,
then the input:
.Pp
.Dl put "\e[31mCool\e[0m" Aq return
.Pp
would become
.Pp
.Dl echo -e "\e[31mCool\e[0m" Aq return
.Pp
Aliases provide a convenient way for naive users to create shorthands for
commands.
They can also be used to create lexically obscure code.
This use is discouraged.

HISTORY
On startup, the history is initialized from the file .simple_shell_history in the $HOME directory.
This file is truncated to
contain no more than 4096 lines of command strings. When the shell startsup,
the first line number is set to  the number of lines in the .simple_shell_history file modulo 4096
(the history size).
